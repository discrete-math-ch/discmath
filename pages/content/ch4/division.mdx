**Definition 4.1**: <br/>
For integers $a$ and $b$, we say that **$a$ divides $b$**, denoted $a \mid b$, if there exists an integer $c$ such that $b = ac$. In this case, $a$ is called a **divisor** of $b$, and $b$ is called a **multiple** of $a$. If $a \neq 0$ and a divisor $c$ exists, it is called the **quotient** when $b$ is divided by $a$, and we write $$c = \frac{b}{a}$$ or $c = b/a$. 4. We write $a \nmid b$ if $a$ does not divide $b$.
