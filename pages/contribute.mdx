## Consistency

### Page structure

We aim to have a separate page for each major subchapter.

 
<Steps>
### Introduction
 
This should contain something like a motivation and the most relevant definition of the chapter. There shouldn't be an extra heading for this. 

### Intuition
This should
 
### Theory

This should contain the necessary theory in condensed matter.
</Steps>

### Callout-Blocks

#### Warnings

Use to warn the reader of some pitfall, misusage or ambiguity:

```mdx
<Callout type="warning">
 Watch out! $\dots$
</Callout>
```

<Callout type="warning">
 Watch out! $\dots$ 
</Callout>



#### Under Construction

Use to denote unfinished sections:

```mdx
<Callout type="warning" emoji="🚧">
  under construction
</Callout>
```
<Callout type="warning" emoji="🚧">
  under construction
</Callout>

#### Remarks

Use to denote a remark which is not primarily related to the content from a page, but connects to content to something related (like a reference to a later chapter):

```mdx
<Callout type="info">
  Note that $\dots$
</Callout>
```

<Callout type="info">
  Note that $\dots$
</Callout>

#### Stories

If you have something on your mind...

```mdx
<Callout emoji="☕️" type="info">
Once upon a time $\dots$
</Callout>
```

<Callout emoji="☕️" type="info">
Once upon atime $\dots$
</Callout>


### Examples


## Writing Problems
To write a problem, you can use the `<Problem/>` component in an `.mdx` file as follows:



```jsx
<Problem title="Problem 1" source="ChatGPT" link="https://chatgpt.com">
      <div label="question">What is $2 + 2$?</div>
      <div label="hint">Think about basic arithmetic.</div>
      <div label="hint">Think again!</div>
      <div label="answer">The answer is $4$.</div>
      <div label="takeaway">Basic arithmetic is fundamental.</div>
      <div label="takeaway">It is important!</div>
</Problem>
```
<Problem title="Problem 1" source="ChatGPT" link="https://chatgpt.com">
  <div label="question">What is $2 + 2$?</div>
      <div label="hint">Think about basic arithmetic.</div>
       <div label="hint">Think again!</div>
      <div label="answer">The answer is $4$.</div>
      <div label="takeaway">Basic arithmetic is fundamental.</div>
      <div label="takeaway">It is important!</div>
</Problem>

The `source` and `link` parameters are optional. You can provide just the `source` parameter, which should be your name if you are setting up your own problem.

The possible types for labels are `question`, `answer`, `hint`, and `takeaway`.

The order of the elements you pass as children to the component matters only within the same label type. For example, the first hint will be labeled as *Hint 1*, the second as *Hint 2*, and so on. However, the overall order of the labels will always follow the sequence: *question, hint, answer, takeaway*. This ensures a consistent structure for the problem presentation.

Additionally, you can have multiple questions, answers, hints or takeaways. The numbering will apply only when there are multiple elements of the same type, such as multiple questions or multiple hints.
