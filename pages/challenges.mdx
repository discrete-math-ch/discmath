<div label="question">
Six mathematicians attend a party. Any two mathematicians either both know each other or both don't know each other. Prove that there must be a group of at least three mathematicians that either all know or all don\'t know each other.
</div>
<div label="hint">
Use the pigeonhole principle.
</div>
<div label="answer">
The question can be formulated as a graph coloring problem: let the mathematicians be the vertices of a complete graph of size 6. Color the edge between two mathematicians red if they know each other, otherwise black. We now wish to prove the existence of a monochromatic triangle in this graph.

Consider an arbitrary vertex $v$ in the graph. $v$ has $5$ edges, which means at least $\left\lceil\frac{5}{2}\right\rceil=3$ of its edges share a color. W.l.o.g., assume they are colored red. Now consider the three vertices these edges lead to. We distinguish 2 cases: 
- If any edge between these three vertices is red, we have our triangle.
- Otherwise, all edges between said vertices are black, which also gives us a monochromatic triangle.

By case distinction, such a triangle must exist.

<Problem
title="Taming the Tuple"
difficulty={3}
relevance={4}
source="Leo Schmidt-Traub"
>
<div label="question">
In the script, you are told that the tuple $(a,b)$ can be uniquely defined as the set $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$. (this means that for any tuples $t_1$ and $t_2$: $t_1=t_2\iff S_{t_1}=S_{t_2}$, where $S_{t_1},S_{t_2}$ are the corresponding sets)

For an arbitrary set $A$, we define $A^*=\bigcup\limits_{n=1}^\infty A^n$ as the set of finite sequences in $A$ (where $A^n=\times_{i=1}^n A$).

Find a way of uniquely defining each element of $A^*$ as a set and prove its correctness. (this set should only be made up of elements of $A$, or nested sets containing elements of $A$) 

You are **not** allowed to assume that the set definition of a tuple shown in the script is adequate, and you are welcome to use a different definition.
</div>
<div label="answer">
The key insight to this question is that any tuple $t=(a_1,\ldots, a_n), n\geq 2$ can be expressed as $((a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}), a_n)$.

We thus simply need to find a representation for the 2-element case that allows us to recurse down to a smaller tuple until we reach a base case (tuple of length 1).

We define for any tuple $(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\in A^n,n\in\mathbb{N}^*$ ($\mathbb N^*=\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}$) the set representation: 
$$
S((a_1,\ldots,a_n))=
\begin{cases}
\{a_1\}&\text{if } n=1\\
\{a_n, \{a_n,S((a_1,\ldots,a_n-1))\}\} &\text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

We now prove that this representation is adequate by induction.
Let $\mathcal P(n)$ be the property defined as:
$$
\mathcal P(n)\iff\forall w\in A^*\forall v\in A^n: (S(w)=S(v)\implies w=v)
$$

Base case:

For $n=1$, consider any $v=(a)\in A^1$ and $w\in A^*$ satisfying $S(w)=S(v)$.

$|S(v)|=|\{a\}|=1$

Assume $w$ has length greater than $1$. Then $w=(b_1,\ldots,b_m)$ for some $m>1$, and $S(w)=\{b_m,\{S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\}\}$.
$$
\begin{align*}
&b_m\in \{b_m,S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\}\\
&\implies b_m\neq \{b_m,S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\} &(\text{a set cannot contain itself})\\
&\implies |S(w)|=2&(S(w)\text{ contains exactly $2$ distinct elements})\\
&\implies |S(v)|=2 & (\text{for } A,B\text{ finite}: A=B\implies |A|=|B|)(\star)\\
\end{align*}
$$
By contradiction, $w$ must have length $1$, meaning $w=(b)$ for some $b\in A$.
$$
\begin{align*}
S(w)=S(v)&\implies \{a\}=\{b\} & (\text{Definition of representation})\\
&\implies a=b & (\text{Lemma 3.1})\\
&\implies (a)=(b)\\
&\implies v=w\\
\end{align*}
$$
Thus, $\mathcal P(1)$ holds

Induction Step:

Assume now that $\mathcal P(n)$ holds for some $n\in\mathbb N^*$. Let $v=(a_1,\ldots, a_{n+1})\in A^{n+1}$ and $w\in A^*$ with $S(w)=S(v)$.

Since $n+1>1$, we know that $|S(v)=2|$ by $(\star)$.
The same line of argumentation as in the base case implies that $w$ must also contain more than $1$ element.

Thus, $w=(b_1,\ldots,b_m)\in A^m$ for some $m>1$.

We thus have:
$\{a_{n+1},\{a_{n+1},S((a_1,\ldots,a_n))\}\}=\{b_m,\{b_m,S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\}\}$

We have previously shown that in this case $S(w)$ contains two distinct elements, one of which is contained in the other.
Let $x$ and $y$ be these two elements. 
We can easily determine $b_m$ by checking if $x\in y$ or if $y\in x$.
W.l.o.g., let $x=b_m$.
We can also determine $S((b_1,\ldots, b_{m-1}))$ by looking at the cardinality of $y$. If $|y|=1$, then $b_m=S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))$ and $y=\{S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\}$, otherwise, $y\setminus\{b_m\}=\{S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m}))\}$.
Either way, $S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))$ is uniquely determined. The same must also hold for $a_{n+1}$ and $S((a_1,\ldots,a_n))$. 
$$
\begin{align*}
S(w)=S(v)&\implies a_{n+1}=b_m\land S((a_1,\ldots,a_n))=S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\\
&\implies a_{n+1}=b_m\land (a_1,\ldots, a_n)=(b_1,\ldots, b_{m-1})&(I.H.)\\
&\implies w=v
\end{align*}
$$
Thus, $\mathcal P(n)\implies \mathcal P(n+1)$

By induction, $\mathcal P(n)$ holds for all $n$, meaning the representation is adequate.

The goal of this exercise is to show that the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1, denoted $[0, 1]$, is uncountable.

In this week's lectures, you encountered the set $\{0, 1\}^{\infty}$ of semi-infinite bitstrings. Cantor's diagonalization argument proves that this set is uncountable.

Through a slight modification of Cantor's diagonalization argument, one can also prove that the set of real numbers $[0, 1]$ is uncountable. However, this exercise prohibits you from using that method.

Instead, use Theorem 3.16 (Bernsteinâ€“SchrÃ¶der theorem) to show $[0, 1] \sim \{0, 1\}^{\infty}$, i.e., show that there is a bijection between these two sets to prove they are equinumerous. Then, conclude that $[0, 1]$ must be uncountable.

<div label="question">
You are working a summer job at the consulate of countability. You are tasked with coloring every point on an infinite piece of paper (you can think of this sheet as $\mathbb R^2$).

To overcome this seemingly insurmountable challenge, you're given an \'irrational stamp\': after having selected a point $p\in\mathbb R^2$, this stamp colors all points in $\mathbb R^2$ that are at an irrational (Euclidean) distance from $p$, i.e. every $q\in\mathbb R^2$ satisfying $\sqrt{(x_p-x_q)^2+(y_p-y_q)^2}\not\in\mathbb Q$.

Is it possible to color the entire plane with a finite number of stamps? If so, what is the minimum number of times you must use your irrational stamp?

**Fermat's Little Theorem:**

$$
a^{p-1} \equiv _{p} 1.

The lecture notes present an elegant proof of this theorem using group theory.  
However, the tools provided in **Chapter 4** are sufficient to prove the theorem by more elementary means.
