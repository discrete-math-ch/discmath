# Countability

Countability is a fundamental concept in set theory and mathematics that deals with the size and nature of sets. The idea that there are different kinds of *infinities* can be quite counterintuitive at first. However, understanding these distinctions is crucial. It helpor uns us determine whether a set is finite, countably infinite, countably infinite, providing insight into concepts like **discrete** and **continuous** (after all this course is called **discrete** mathematics). This understanding significantly influences how we can classify and think about different problems, particularly in computer science.

This chapter is one where you can truly get creative with proofs, and sometimes you have to. That's what makes proofs so rewarding — sometimes it's just about finding that neat idea. Often, people think this makes the chapter harder because there isn't this one approach, which is similar in every problem. It requires a lot of practice to build up intuition and ideas that you can adapt to different cases. But this is what makes it so enjoyable - really believe. Every problem is more or less unique, unlike for proving something, and sometimes have to. Thats what makes proofs really rewarding - sometimes it just this neat idea. Oftentime people think this makes this chapter harder, because afterall there is no recipe to approach every problem. It just a lot of practice which builds up some intuition and idea you might be able to use and alter in different cases. But this really makes is super fun. Because every problem is really different. Not like in the basics of set theory, where proofs always went by showing double-sided inclusion.

<Callout type="axiom">
**Definition 3.42**: 
1. Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **equinumerous**, denoted $A \sim B$, if there exists a bijection $A \to B$.
2. The set $B$ **dominates** the set $A$, denotes $A \preccurlyeq B$, if $A \sim C$ for some subset $C \subseteq B$ or, equivalently if there exists an injective function $A \to B$.
3. A set $A$ is called **countable** if $f : A \preccurlyeq \mathbb{N}$, and **uncountable** otherwise.

</Callout>

The central aspect of this chapter is to decide whether a given set $A$ is countable or uncountable. More precisly you need to find an injection/bijection $\mathbb{N} \to A$ or find some other way to show that there is none.


## Intuition

The most surprsing fact in this chapter is probably that if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \neq A$ it is still possible that $A$ and $B$ contain *the same number of elements$ (in the sense of **cardinality**).



## Theory

The proofs for the following theorems can be found in the script and won't be recited here.

<Callout type="-">
**Lemma 3.15**: 
1. The relation $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.
2. The relation $\preccurlyeq$ is transitive: $A \preccurlyeq B \land B \preccurlyeq C \Rightarrow A \preccurlyeq C$.
3. $A \subseteq B \Rightarrow A \preccurlyeq B$.
</Callout>

The first point provides us with major intuition about countability. And the proof follows quite immediate from composing two bijections and obtaining a new one. This is a central idea. These properties can be combined with *proof-patterns* to prove uncountability or countability.



<Callout type="-">
**Theorem 3.16**: 
If $A \preccurlyeq B$ and $B \preccurlyeq A$, then $A \sim B$.
</Callout>
This is a rather *extra theorem*. Though, it's sort of intuivive. It somehow captures a notion of antisymmetry (however not in the sense that $A = B$, but only $A \sim B$). It will probably be rarely or might be never be the case in this course that it is easier to show that these two injections exist than that a bijection $A \to B$ exists. 

<Callout type="-">
**Theorem 3.17**: 
A set $A$ is countable if and only if it is finite or if $A \sim \mathbb{N}$. This implies there is no cardinality level between finite and countably infinite sets.
</Callout>

### Important Countable Sets

<Callout type="-">
**Theorem 3.18**: 
The set $\{0, 1\}^*$, defined as $\{\epsilon, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, \ldots\}$ of finite binary sequences, is countable.
</Callout>
This is a goto set to prove countability. Finding an injection to $\{0,1\}^*$ is often the base of a proof and combining this with Lemma **3.15** (Transitivity), we quickly obtain countability.



<Callout type="-">
**Theorem 3.19**: 
The set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ of ordered pairs of natural numbers is countable.

</Callout>

<Callout type="-">
**Corollary 3.20**: 
The Cartesian product $A \times B$ of two countable sets $A$ and $B$ is countable, i.e., $A \preccurlyeq \mathbb{N} \land B \preccurlyeq \mathbb{N} \Rightarrow A \times B \preccurlyeq \mathbb{N}$.
</Callout>



<Callout type="-">
**Corollary 3.21**: 
The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.
</Callout>



<Callout type="-">
**Theorem 3.22**: 
Let $A$ and $A_i$ for $i \in \mathbb{N}$ be countable sets.
1. For any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the set $A^n$ of $n$-tuples over $A$ is countable.
2. The union $\bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} A_i$ of a countable list $A_0, A_1, A_2, \ldots$ of countable sets is countable.
3. The set $A^*$ of finite sequences of elements from $A$ is countable.
</Callout>

This is another very central theorem and in the case of certain involved set operations, should be considered as a starting point for proving that some complicated set is countable.

<Callout type="-">
**Definition 3.43**: 
Let $\{0, 1\}^\infty$ denote the set of semi-infinite binary sequences or, equivalently, the set of functions $\mathbb{N} \to \{0, 1\}$.
</Callout>
Just in case you are wondering: Why are they called semi-infinite? This is because they go infinite in *one-direction*. 
This is often super useful. We can think about functions as infinite 

<Callout type="warning">
There is a major difference between the set of semi-infinite bitstrings $\{0,1\}^{\infty}$ and $\{0,1\}^*$. 

The set $\{0,1\}^*$ represents all **finite** sequences (or strings) of bits, including the empty string. Each string in $\{0,1\}^*$ has a **finite** length, and the set is countably infinite because we can list all possible finite bitstrings in a sequence.

On the other hand, the set of semi-infinite bitstrings consists of all sequences of bits that extend **infinitely** in one direction. Each bitstring in this set has an infinite length, and the set is uncountably infinite.

For example we have $0 \in \{0,1\}^*$ but $0 \notin \{0,1\}^{\infty}$. But $000\dots \in \{0,1\}^{\infty}$ (the semi-infinite string of $0$'s).
</Callout> 


<Callout type="-">
**Theorem 3.23**: 
The set $\{0, 1\}^\infty$ is uncountable.

</Callout>

This theorem is central and a thought about the uncountability of $\{0,1\}^{\infty}$ should be a possible starting point for any uncountability proof. 

#### Computability
<Callout type="-">
**Definition 3.44**: 
A function $f : \mathbb{N} \to \{0,1\}$ is called computable if there is a program that, for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$, when given $n$ as input, outputs $f(n)$.
</Callout>

<Callout type="-">
**Corollary 3.24**: There are **uncomputable function** $\mathbb{N} \to \{0,1\}$
</Callout>
