<div label="question">
Six mathematicians attend a party. Any two mathematicians either both know each other or both don't know each other. Prove that there must be a group of at least three mathematicians that either all know or all don\'t know each other.
</div>
<div label="hint">
Use the pigeonhole principle.
</div>
<div label="answer">
The question can be formulated as a graph coloring problem: let the mathematicians be the vertices of a complete graph of size 6. Color the edge between two mathematicians red if they know each other, otherwise black. We now wish to prove the existence of a monochromatic triangle in this graph.

Consider an arbitrary vertex $v$ in the graph. $v$ has $5$ edges, which means at least $\left\lceil\frac{5}{2}\right\rceil=3$ of its edges share a color. W.l.o.g., assume they are colored red. Now consider the three vertices these edges lead to. We distinguish 2 cases: 
- If any edge between these three vertices is red, we have our triangle.
- Otherwise, all edges between said vertices are black, which also gives us a monochromatic triangle.

By case distinction, such a triangle must exist.

<Problem
title="Taming the Tuple"
difficulty={3}
relevance={4}
source="Leo Schmidt-Traub"
>
<div label="question">
In the script, you are told that the tuple $(a,b)$ can be uniquely defined as the set $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$. (this means that for any tuples $t_1$ and $t_2$: $t_1=t_2\iff S_{t_1}=S_{t_2}$, where $S_{t_1},S_{t_2}$ are the corresponding sets)

For an arbitrary set $A$, we define $A^*=\bigcup\limits_{n=1}^\infty A^n$ as the set of finite sequences in $A$ (where $A^n=\times_{i=1}^n A$).

Find a way of uniquely defining each element of $A^*$ as a set and prove its correctness. (this set should only be made up of elements of $A$, or nested sets containing elements of $A$) 

You are **not** allowed to assume that the set definition of a tuple shown in the script is adequate, and you are welcome to use a different definition.
</div>
<div label="answer">
The key insight to this question is that any tuple $t=(a_1,\ldots, a_n), n\geq 2$ can be expressed as $((a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}), a_n)$.

We thus simply need to find a representation for the 2-element case that allows us to recurse down to a smaller tuple until we reach a base case (tuple of length 1).

We define for any tuple $(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\in A^n,n\in\mathbb{N}^*$ ($\mathbb N^*=\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}$) the set representation: 
$$
S((a_1,\ldots,a_n))=
\begin{cases}
\{a_1\}&\text{if } n=1\\
\{a_n, \{a_n,S((a_1,\ldots,a_n-1))\}\} &\text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

We now prove that this representation is adequate by induction.
Let $\mathcal P(n)$ be the property defined as:
$$
\mathcal P(n)\iff\forall w\in A^*\forall v\in A^n: (S(w)=S(v)\implies w=v)
$$

Base case:

For $n=1$, consider any $v=(a)\in A^1$ and $w\in A^*$ satisfying $S(w)=S(v)$.

$|S(v)|=|\{a\}|=1$

Assume $w$ has length greater than $1$. Then $w=(b_1,\ldots,b_m)$ for some $m>1$, and $S(w)=\{b_m,\{S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\}\}$.
$$
\begin{align*}
&b_m\in \{b_m,S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\}\\
&\implies b_m\neq \{b_m,S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\} &(\text{a set cannot contain itself})\\
&\implies |S(w)|=2&(S(w)\text{ contains exactly $2$ distinct elements})\\
&\implies |S(v)|=2 & (\text{for } A,B\text{ finite}: A=B\implies |A|=|B|)(\star)\\
\end{align*}
$$
By contradiction, $w$ must have length $1$, meaning $w=(b)$ for some $b\in A$.
$$
\begin{align*}
S(w)=S(v)&\implies \{a\}=\{b\} & (\text{Definition of representation})\\
&\implies a=b & (\text{Lemma 3.1})\\
&\implies (a)=(b)\\
&\implies v=w\\
\end{align*}
$$
Thus, $\mathcal P(1)$ holds

Induction Step:

Assume now that $\mathcal P(n)$ holds for some $n\in\mathbb N^*$. Let $v=(a_1,\ldots, a_{n+1})\in A^{n+1}$ and $w\in A^*$ with $S(w)=S(v)$.

Since $n+1>1$, we know that $|S(v)=2|$ by $(\star)$.
The same line of argumentation as in the base case implies that $w$ must also contain more than $1$ element.

Thus, $w=(b_1,\ldots,b_m)\in A^m$ for some $m>1$.

We thus have:
$\{a_{n+1},\{a_{n+1},S((a_1,\ldots,a_n))\}\}=\{b_m,\{b_m,S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\}\}$

We have previously shown that in this case $S(w)$ contains two distinct elements, one of which is contained in the other.
Let $x$ and $y$ be these two elements. 
We can easily determine $b_m$ by checking if $x\in y$ or if $y\in x$.
W.l.o.g., let $x=b_m$.
We can also determine $S((b_1,\ldots, b_{m-1}))$ by looking at the cardinality of $y$. If $|y|=1$, then $b_m=S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))$ and $y=\{S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\}$, otherwise, $y\setminus\{b_m\}=\{S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m}))\}$.
Either way, $S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))$ is uniquely determined. The same must also hold for $a_{n+1}$ and $S((a_1,\ldots,a_n))$. 
$$
\begin{align*}
S(w)=S(v)&\implies a_{n+1}=b_m\land S((a_1,\ldots,a_n))=S((b_1,\ldots,b_{m-1}))\\
&\implies a_{n+1}=b_m\land (a_1,\ldots, a_n)=(b_1,\ldots, b_{m-1})&(I.H.)\\
&\implies w=v
\end{align*}
$$
Thus, $\mathcal P(n)\implies \mathcal P(n+1)$

By induction, $\mathcal P(n)$ holds for all $n$, meaning the representation is adequate.

The goal of this exercise is to show that the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1, denoted $[0, 1]$, is uncountable.

In this week's lectures, you encountered the set $\{0, 1\}^{\infty}$ of semi-infinite bitstrings. Cantor's diagonalization argument proves that this set is uncountable.

Through a slight modification of Cantor's diagonalization argument, one can also prove that the set of real numbers $[0, 1]$ is uncountable. However, this exercise prohibits you from using that method.

Instead, use Theorem 3.16 (Bernstein–Schröder theorem) to show $[0, 1] \sim \{0, 1\}^{\infty}$, i.e., show that there is a bijection between these two sets to prove they are equinumerous. Then, conclude that $[0, 1]$ must be uncountable.

You are working a summer job at the consulate of countability. You are tasked with coloring every point on an infinite piece of paper (you can think of this sheet as $\mathbb R^2$).

To overcome this seemingly insurmountable challenge, you're given an \'irrational stamp\': after having selected a point $p\in\mathbb R^2$, this stamp colors all points in $\mathbb R^2$ that are at an irrational (Euclidean) distance from $p$, i.e. every $q\in\mathbb R^2$ satisfying $\sqrt{(x_p-x_q)^2+(y_p-y_q)^2}\not\in\mathbb Q$.

Is it possible to color the entire plane with a finite number of stamps? If so, what is the minimum number of times you must use your irrational stamp?

<div label="question">
Let $A$ be an arbitrary set, and $\text{Eq}(A)$ the set of equivalence relations on $A$.

Prove that $(\text{Eq}(A);\subseteq)$ is a lattice.
</div>
<div label="answer">
$\text{Eq}(A)\subseteq\mathcal P(A)$, meaning the elements of $\text{Eq}(A)$ are sets, and $\subseteq$ satisfies antisymmetry (def. of set equality), transitivity (Lemma 3.3) and reflexivity ($\forall S\in\text{Eq}(A):S=S\implies\forall S\in\text{Eq}(A): S\subseteq S$).
Thus $(\text{Eq}(A);\subseteq)$ is a poset.

We prove that $(\text{Eq}(A);\subseteq)$ is a lattice by showing that every pair of equivalence relations on $A$ has a meet and a join.

For all $\rho,\sigma\in\text{Eq}(A)$, consider $\pi=\rho\cap\sigma$.
By Lemma 3.10, $\pi\in\text{Eq}(A)$.
Furthermore,  for all $\theta\in \text{Eq}(A)$: 
$$
\begin{align*}
&\theta\subseteq \rho\land\theta\subseteq \sigma\\
\implies& \forall x\in\theta : (x\in \rho\land x\in \sigma)&(\text{def. }\subseteq)\\
\implies& \forall x\in\theta : (x\in \rho\cap \sigma)&(\text{def. }\cap)\\
\implies& \theta\subseteq\pi&(\text{def. }\subseteq)
\end{align*}
$$
Thus, $\pi=\text{glb}(\rho,\sigma)\implies \pi=\rho\land\sigma$.

Now consider the relation $\pi=(\rho\cup\sigma)^*$.

Reflexive:

$$
\begin{align*}
\rho\text{ reflexive}&\implies \text{id}_A\subseteq\rho & (\text{def. reflexive})\\
&\implies \text{id}_A\subseteq \pi & (\text{id}_A\subseteq\rho\subseteq\rho\cup\sigma\subseteq\pi)\\
&\implies \pi\text{ reflexive} & (\text{def. reflexive})
\end{align*}
$$

Symmetric:


We prove by induction that for all $k\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}$, $(\pi\cup\sigma)^k$ is symmetric.

B: $k=1$
For all $(x,y)\in A\times A$:
$$
\begin{align*}
x(\rho\cup\sigma)y&\implies x\rho y\lor x\sigma y &(\text{def. }\cup)\\
&\implies y\rho x\lor y\sigma x &(\text{def. symmetry})\\
&\implies y(\rho\cup\sigma)x
\end{align*}
$$

IH: Assume $(\rho\cup\sigma)^k$ symmetric for some $k\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}$:
IS:
$$
\begin{align*}
\widehat{(\rho\cup\sigma)^{k+1}}&=\widehat{(\rho\cup\sigma)^{k}(\rho\cup\sigma)} &(\text{def. composition})\\
&=\widehat{(\rho\cup\sigma)}\widehat{(\rho\cup\sigma)^{k}} &(\text{Lemma 3.8})\\
&=(\rho\cup\sigma)(\rho\cup\sigma)^{k}&(\text{Base case + Induction hypothesis})\\
&=(\rho\cup\sigma)^{k+1}&(\text{def. composition})
\end{align*}
$$

By induction, $(\pi\cup\sigma)^k$ is symmetric for all $k\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}$. $(\star)$

For all $(x,y)\in\pi$:
$$
\begin{align*}
x\pi y&\implies(x,y)\in\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}}(\rho\cup\sigma)^n & (\text{def. transitive closure})\\
&\implies \exists k\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}:x(\rho\cup\sigma)^ky & (\text{def. }\cup)\\
&\implies \exists k\in \mathbb N\setminus\{0\}:y(\rho\cup\sigma)^kx & (\star)\\
&\implies y\pi x &(\text{def. transitive closure})
\end{align*}
$$

Transitivity:

For an arbitrary relation $\theta\subseteq A\times A$, consider any $x,y,z\in A$ satisfying $x\theta^* y$ and $y\theta^* z$.

By the definition of $\theta^*$, there must exist $k,l\in\mathbb{N}$ satisfying $x\theta ^k y$ and $y\theta^l z$, which implies $x\theta^{k+l}z$ (def of composition).

Since $k+l\in\mathbb{N}\setminus\{0\}$, $x\theta^*z$. $\theta^*$ is therefore transitive, and so is $\pi$.


$\pi$ reflexive, symmetric and transitive $\implies$ $\pi\in\text{Eq}(A)$.

For all upper bounds $\theta\in\text{Eq}(A)$ of $\rho$ and $\sigma$, we prove by induction that $\forall k\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}:(\rho\cup\sigma)^k\subseteq \theta$.


B: $k=1$
For all $(x,y)\in\rho\cup\sigma$:
$$
\begin{align*}
x\rho\cup\sigma y&\implies x\rho y\lor x\sigma y & (\text{def. }\cup)\\
&\implies x\theta y\lor x\theta y & (\rho\subseteq\theta,\sigma\subseteq\theta)\\
&\implies x\theta y &(\text{Idempotence})\\
&\implies \rho\cup\sigma\subseteq\theta\\
\end{align*}
$$

IH: Assume this holds for some $k\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}$.

IS:
For all $(x,y)\in(\rho\cup\sigma)^{k+1}$:
$$
\begin{align*}
&x(\rho\cup\sigma)^{k+1}y\\
&\implies \exists z:x(\rho\cup\sigma)z\land z(\rho\cup\sigma)^ky& (\text{def. composition})\\
&\implies \exists z: x\theta z\land z\theta y &(\text{Base case + Induction hypothesis})\\
&\implies x\theta y & (\theta\text{ transitive})\\
&\implies (\rho\cup\sigma)^{k+1}\subseteq \theta
\end{align*}
$$

By induction, this holds for all $k\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}$. $(*)$

For all $(x,y)\in\pi$:

$$
\begin{align*}
x\pi y&\implies\exists k\in\mathbb N\setminus\{0\}:x(\rho\cup\sigma)^ky &(\text{def. transitive closure})\\
&\implies x\theta y&(*)\\
&\implies \pi\subseteq\theta 
\end{align*}
$$

Thus $\pi$ is the join of $\rho$ and $\sigma$.

Since any two elements of $\text{Eq}(A)$ have a meet and a join, $\text{Eq}(A)$ is a lattice.
