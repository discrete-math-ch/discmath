<Problem title="Problem 1" source="Tobias Steinbrecher">
  <div label="question">
  Define logical binary operator $\circ$ as follows:

    |$A$ | $B$ | $A \circ B$|
    |---|---|---|
    |$0$ |$0$ | $1$ |
    |$0$ |$1$ | $1$ |
    |$1$ |$0$ | $1$ |
    |$1$ |$1$ | $0$ |

    For each of the following formulas, write an **equivalent** formula using only the $\circ$ operator. Prove the equivalence in each case.
  1. $\lnot A$ <br/>
  2. $A \land B$ <br/>
  3. $A \lor B$ <br/>
  </div>
  <div label="answer">
   First consider:

  |$A$|$\lnot A$|
  |---|---|
  | 0| 1|
  | 1| 0|

      We have to somehow use $\circ$ such that the formula *evaluates* to false exactly when $A$ is $1$. 
    One could for example find the formula $A \circ A$ and prove the result by writing the function table:

    | $A$ |$A \circ A $|
      |---|---|
      | 0| 1|
      | 1| 0|

  which is indeed equivalent. Usually one has to make observations in these types of problems and use them cleverly to create the formula. Thus
  $$
  \lnot A \equiv A \circ A
  $$
  </div>
<div label="answer">
Consider $(A \circ B) \circ (A \circ B)$ 

 |$A$ | $B$ | $(A \circ B) \circ (A \circ B)$ | $A \land B$ |
    |---|---|---| ---| 
    |$0$ |$0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
    |$0$ |$1$ | $0$ |$0$ |
    |$1$ |$0$ | $0$ |$0$ |
    |$1$ |$1$ | $1$ |$1$ |

The idea here is to use the $\lnot$ operator from the previous exercise to invert the outcome of $A \circ B$, which is exactly $A \land B$ (more precisely, $\circ$ is a [NAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffer_stroke) function). 

</div>

<div label="answer">

Consider $(A \circ A) \circ (B \circ B)$ 

 |$A$ | $B$ | $(A \circ A) \circ (B \circ B)$ | $A \lor B$ |
    |---|---|---| ---| 
    |$0$ |$0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
    |$0$ |$1$ | $1$ |$1$ |
    |$1$ |$0$ | $1$ |$1$ |
    |$1$ |$1$ | $1$ |$1$ |

Note that $A \circ B \equiv \lnot (A \land B)$ (NAND operation).
The idea here is to use the $\lnot$ operator we build in the previous exercise to invert $A$ and $B$ individually. Then we basically use De Morgan's equivalence: $\lnot(\lnot A \land \lnot B) \equiv A \lor B$ to obtain the final result (i.e. one more $\circ$ operation between $\lnot A$ and $\lnot B$).

  <div label= "takeaway">   Usually one has to make some kind of observations in these types problems and use them cleverly to create the formula. Sometimes known equivalences such as in the 3. subtask can help.  
   To prove the **equivalence** one can then simply use *comparison of function tables* (this step is trivial in comparison to finding a correct function). Note that there might be more than one possible solution.</div>

<Problem title="Problem 2" source="Philipp Barski">
  <div label="question">
      Consider the formula $F = (B \lor A) \lor \neg C$. Find a formula $G$ such that $G$ only contains the logical operation $\to$ and propositonal symbols $A,B,C$ (Note that parentheses are allowed as well).<br/> 
       Solve this problem either by using equivalence transformations from Lemma 2.1 and the rules 
       $$
       F \land \neg F \equiv \bot, \  F \land \bot \equiv \bot, \ F \lor \bot \equiv F,\  F \lor \neg F \equiv \top, \ F \land \top \equiv F, \ F \lor \top \equiv \top
       $$ 
       or drawing the truth table and trying to find a formula fulfilling the upper constraints.
  </div>
  <div label="answer">
    We provide an answer using equivalence transformations. The idea is to see that the formula has a form that could give a hint that $C$ will be on the left side of the arrow according to the definition. We just need to find a trick such that the formula gets a better form for us to use, maybe we can find a form similar to the definition of the arrow "$\to$", or the negation of "$\to$"? We provide a formal solution in the following. 
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      && (B \lor A) \lor \neg C &&\\
      \equiv && ((B \lor A) \land \top) \lor \neg C &&\text{($F \land \top \equiv F$)}\\
      \equiv && ((B \lor A) \land (B \lor \neg B)) \lor \neg C &&\text{($F \lor \neg F \equiv \top$)}\\
      \equiv && (B \lor (A \land \neg B)) \lor \neg C &&\text{(distr. law)}\\
      \equiv && ((A \land \neg B) \lor B) \lor \neg C &&\text{(commutativity)}\\
      \equiv && (A \land \neg B) \lor (B \lor \neg C) &&\text{(associativity)}\\
      \equiv && (A \land \neg B) \lor (\neg C \lor B) &&\text{(commutativity)}\\
      \equiv && (A \land \neg B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(def. "$\to$")}\\
      \equiv && (\neg \neg A \land \neg B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(double negation)}\\
      \equiv && \neg (\neg A \lor B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(De Morgan's law)}\\
      \equiv && \neg (A \to B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(Def. "$\to$")}\\
      \equiv && (A \to B) \to (C \to B) &&\text{(Def. "$\to$")}\\
    \end{aligned}
    $$
  </div>

  <div label="hint">
    The trick when using equivalence transformations here is to make this step: 
    $$
    (B \lor A) \lor \neg C \equiv ((B \lor A) \land \top) \lor \neg C
    $$
     How can we conveniently replace $\top$ such that the formula looks like something we can transform further?
  </div>
  <div label= "takeaway">
  For such problems you often need to find a clever trick to get the formula to some other nice form. Often, the first thing you want to do is trying out some common tricks and seeing whether you could get the formula into any other form. It is also possible to write down the truth table and try to fit a formula to the truth values.
