# Number Theory

The Number Theory is a wonderful part of mathematics which studies how to solve various problems using properties that different numbers possess.

## Motivation

As a **motivation for studying**, the following example might be good:

<Callout type="-"> 
**Is there a solution of $x^3 + x^2 = y^4 + y + 1$ for some integers $x$, $y$?**

Aaaand ... No there is no solution due to the fact that both sides can't be at the same time:

$$
\text{odd} = \text{odd} \text{ or } \text{even} = \text{even}
$$ 

**Let us take two cases:**
1. **$y = \text{even}$**, then when we have $y^4 + y + 1$, then $y^4$ is as well even,. Now, adding  $(y^4) \  \text{even} + (y) \  \text{even} = \text{even}$. Finally, $((y^4 + y) + 1)$ results in $\text{even} + \text{odd}$, which is always $\text{odd}$.
2. **$y = \text{odd}$**, then $y^4 + y + 1 = \text{odd} + \text{odd} + \text{odd} = \text{odd}$

So the LHS is always odd. Now, considering LHS, we can do a **similar analysis**:

1. **$x = \text{even}$**, then $x^3 + x^2 = \text{even} + \text{even} = \text{even}$
2. **$x = \text{odd}$**, then $x^3 + x^2 = \text{odd} + \text{odd} = \text{even}$

RHS is always $\text{even}$. Here we arrive at a **contradiction** ⚡️
$\text{even} \neq \text{odd}$, which proves, that there is no solution to the given equation. 
</Callout>

This **example reveals** that by knowing how even and odd numbers react to adding them or raising to some power (in a sense **knowing some theory behind these numbers**), we can prove that there is no solution for a given equation. The example above is shown **informally** and serves rather as an **intuition and motivation**.  

## References

The following are some references to problem sets which were quite useful to get more practice with number theory. I think some of them were super useful during the exam preparation. In this chapter practice and experience really is the way to go:

- [*250 Problems in elementary number theory* - Sierpinski (1970)](https://www.isinj.com/mt-aime/250%20Problems%20in%20Elementary%20Number%20Theory%20-%20Sierpinski%20(1970).pdf): I would recommend looking at some problems from here and spending some time thinking about them. Obviously some parts of the problem set are not solvable with the knowledge which is relevant for this course (such as part 5 about diophantine equations). However part 1 and 2 are pretty interesting and it turns out that there are some problems in this set which actually occured in exactly like this in old exams - so the style of the exercises matches pretty good.

- [*MATH 312 An Introduction to number theory: problem sets* - University of British Colombia](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~lior/teaching/1718/312_S18/Notes/PracticeSets.pdf): Very nice problem set with interesting exercises. Some of them are a bit out of scope, but the first sections definitly provide good practice to get faster with computations or get an intuition for core proof strategies.
