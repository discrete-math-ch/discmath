## Quick Questions
*True or False?*
$$
 \vDash A \lor \lnot A
$$ 
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  True, because either $A$ or $\lnot A$ will always be true, we obtain that $A \lor \lnot A$ is a tautology. We use the notation $\vDash F$ to express this fact. 
</details>

*If $F$ is a tautology, then $\lnot F$ is unsatisfiable.*

<details>
<summary>
Solution
</summary>
True, see **Lemma 2.2** in script.
</details>

*What is a Universe in predicate logic?*
1. The set of all formulas of predicate logic
2. A function which assigns 0 or 1 to each element of a set.
3. A formula that is true in every interpretation
4. The set of objects we want to reason about

*True or false?*

$$
((A \to B) \lor B) \land C \vDash ((A \to B) \lor (B \to C)) \lor (A \to C)) \lor C
$$

<details>
<summary>
Solution
</summary>
True, one can make the observation that in every case where the left-hand side is true, $C$ must be $1$. Therefore, we obtain that the right-hand side automatically becomes true. Thus, we have indeed a logical consequence.
</details>

*Correct application of exaclty **one** rule of Lemma 2.1?*

$$
    \lnot(\lnot A \land C) \equiv A \lor \lnot C 
$$

<details>
<summary>
Solution
</summary>
No, we used **double negation** and **De-morgan** at once, we should split it up as follows:
$$
    \lnot(\lnot A \land C) \equiv \lnot \lnot A \lor \lnot C \equiv A \lor \lnot C 
$$
</details>

*Correct application of exaclty **one** rule of Lemma 2.1?*

$$
    A \land (B \lor C) \equiv  (A \land B) \lor (A \land C)
$$

<details>
<summary>
Solution
</summary>
Yes, we have used only a distributive law.
</details>

*Which statements are true?*

1. There are infinitely many interpretations in predicate logic, while there are only finitely many in propositional logic.
2. A formula of predicate logic always has a fixed truth value
3. Qunatifiers only exists in predicate logic
4. Propositional Logic is stronger than predicate logic, i.e. we can express more statements.

<details>
<summary>
Solution
</summary>
True, False, True, False.
</details>

*True or False?*

$$
\forall x \forall y P(x,y) \equiv \forall y \forall x P(x,y)
$$

<details>
<summary>
Solution
</summary>
True. See **2.4.7** in script.
</details>

*Under which interpretation is the following formula true?*

$$
\forall  x \forall  y \exists  z \ \left(P\left(x,y\right) \to  \left(P\left(x,z\right) \land P\left(z,y\right)\right)\right)
$$

1. Universe $U = \mathbb{N}$ and $P(x,y) = 1 \iff x < y$
2. Universe $U = \mathbb{N}$ and $P(x,y) = 1 \iff x \leq y$
3. Universe $U = \mathbb{R}$ and $P(x,y) = 1 \iff x < y$
4. Universe $U = \mathbb{N}$ and $P(x,y) = 1 \iff x \text{ is even}$

2., 3. and 4.

## Predicate Logic

A short rundown of the main concepts:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="💡">
 **Interpretations and Universes** Instead of assigning truth values to the propositional symbols to interpret the formula and obtain a mathematical statement, as we did in propositional logic, we now always have to choose a set of mathematical objects (such as $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{R}$ or simlar) we want to reason about. We call this set the **Universe** denoted by $U$.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning" emoji="💡">
 **Predicates** take elements from the universe and spit out a truth value** ($P : U^k \to \{0,1\}$). *Example interpretations for predicates: $\text{prime}(x), \text{less}(x,y)$.*
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning" emoji="💡">
 **Functions** take elements from the universe and spit out an element from the Universe** ($f : U^k \to U$). *Example interpretations for functions: $x + y$, $x^2$ (note that we sometimes use the infix notation and not something like $\text{plus}(x,y)$)*
</Callout> 

<Callout type="warning" emoji="💡">
**Quantifiers**:
1. $\forall x$ F is true if for any value $x$ in $U$, formula $F$ is true.
2. $\exists x$ F is true if there exists $x$ in $U$, such that formula $F$ is true.
</Callout> 

By combining these elements, predicate logic allows for the creation of more complex and expressive statements than propositional logic.


## Exercises

<Problem title="Translation of predicate logic" source="Leon Kolmanic (HS23)" link="https://leonkolmanic.com/">
  <div label="question">
  Consider the following **interpretation**.
      Let $U = \mathbb{Z}$ be the universe. And
      $$
      Q(x) = 1 \iff x \text{ is square}
      $$
      $$
      P(x,y) = 1 \iff x = y
      $$
      $$
      \text{sum}(x,y) = x+y
      $$
      Write down formulas of predicate logic, such that our interpretation is fitting and is expressing the following statements (numbers refer to integers):
      1. There is a square number
      2. The sum of two arbitrary numbers is not square
      3. For every number $a$, there is a number $b$, such that $a + b$ is square
      4. The sum of two squares is a square

      Additionally, translate these formulas into statments under the given interpretation:
      1. $\forall x \forall y ((Q(x) \land Q(y)) \to P(x,y))$
      2. $\forall x (Q(x) \to (\exists a \exists b P(x,\text{sum}(a,b))))$
  </div>
  <div label="answer">
    1. $\exists Q(x)$
    2. $\forall x \forall y \  (\lnot Q(\text{sum}(x+y)))$
    3. $\forall x \exists y \ Q(\text{sum}(x,y))$
    4. $\forall x \forall y \ ((Q(x) \land Q(y)) \to Q(\text{sum}(x,y)))$
  </div>
   <div label="answer">
    1. There is only one square number (if two numbers are square, then they are equal)
    2. Every square number is the sum of two numbers
  </div>
</Problem>

<Problem title="Equivalence Transformations" source="Philipp Barski">
  <div label="question">
      Consider the formula $F = (B \lor A) \lor \neg C$. Find a formula $G$ such that $G$ only contains the logical operation $\to$ and propositonal symbols $A,B,C$ (Note that parentheses are allowed as well).<br/> 
       Solve this problem either by using equivalence transformations from Lemma 2.1 and the rules 
       $$
       F \land \neg F \equiv \bot, \  F \land \bot \equiv \bot, \ F \lor \bot \equiv F,\  F \lor \neg F \equiv \top, \ F \land \top \equiv F, \ F \lor \top \equiv \top
       $$ 
       or drawing the truth table and trying to find a formula fulfilling the upper constraints.
  </div>
  <div label="answer">
    We provide an answer using equivalence transformations. The idea is to see that the formula has a form that could give a hint that $C$ will be on the left side of the arrow according to the definition. We just need to find a trick such that the formula gets a better form for us to use, maybe we can find a form similar to the definition of the arrow "$\to$", or the negation of "$\to$"? We provide a formal solution in the following. 
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      && (B \lor A) \lor \neg C &&\\
      \equiv && ((B \lor A) \land \top) \lor \neg C &&\text{($F \land \top \equiv F$)}\\
      \equiv && ((B \lor A) \land (B \lor \neg B)) \lor \neg C &&\text{($F \lor \neg F \equiv \top$)}\\
      \equiv && (B \lor (A \land \neg B)) \lor \neg C &&\text{(distr. law)}\\
      \equiv && ((A \land \neg B) \lor B) \lor \neg C &&\text{(commutativity)}\\
      \equiv && (A \land \neg B) \lor (B \lor \neg C) &&\text{(associativity)}\\
      \equiv && (A \land \neg B) \lor (\neg C \lor B) &&\text{(commutativity)}\\
      \equiv && (A \land \neg B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(def. "$\to$")}\\
      \equiv && (\neg \neg A \land \neg B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(double negation)}\\
      \equiv && \neg (\neg A \lor B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(De Morgan's law)}\\
      \equiv && \neg (A \to B) \lor (C \to B) &&\text{(Def. "$\to$")}\\
      \equiv && (A \to B) \to (C \to B) &&\text{(Def. "$\to$")}\\
    \end{aligned}
    $$
  </div>

  <div label="hint">
    The trick when using equivalence transformations here is to make this step: 
    $$
    (B \lor A) \lor \neg C \equiv ((B \lor A) \land \top) \lor \neg C
    $$
     How can we conveniently replace $\top$ such that the formula looks like something we can transform further?
  </div>
  <div label= "takeaway">
  For such problems you often need to find a clever trick to get the formula to some other nice form. Often, the first thing you want to do is trying out some common tricks and seeing whether you could get the formula into any other form. It is also possible to write down the truth table and try to fit a formula to the truth values.
