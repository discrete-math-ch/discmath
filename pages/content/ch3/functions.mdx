# Functions

## Definition

A function $f: A \to B$ is a special type of relation from $A$ to $B$; intuitively speaking, a totally and well-defined function must have a single output for each input, i.e. $f(a), a \in A$ is a single element.

## Image

For some function $f: A \to B$, the image of $A' \subseteq A$ are all elements that are "reached" from $A'$, i.e. $f(A') = \{ b \in B \; \vert \; \exists a \in A' (f(a') = b) \}$

## Preimage

The preimage of $B' \subset B$ under $f: A \to B$ are all elements in $A$ that map to some element in $B'$, i.e. $f^{-1}(B') = \{ a \in A \; \vert \; f(a) \in B' \}$.

While the inverse $f^{-1}$ might not be defined, the preimage is always defined.

## Special Properties

A function $f: A \to B$ can have "special" properties:

- A function is injective, if any two distinct input elements map to two different outputs ($\forall a \forall a' \left[ a \ne a' \to f(a) \ne f(a') \right]$). For "finite" functions (the relation $f$ is finite), this is equivalent to $|A| = |f(A)|$.
- A function is surjective, if for every element in $B$ there exists some element $a$ in $A$ such that $f(a) = b$, or equivalently, that $f(A) = B$
- A function is bijective if it is injective and surjective.

# Exercises

<Problem title="Preimage relation" source="Max Obreiter">
    <div label="question">
        Show that for every $f: A \to B$ and $B' \subseteq B$, the following holds:
        $$
            \{ (f(a), a) \in B' \times A \} = \text{id}_{B'} \circ \hat{f}
        $$
        If we "removed" the first element from the tuple of the LHS (but retaining the condition that $f(a) \in B'$), we would get the definition of the preimage. This definition is a bit more powerful since we also know which elements map to what.

<Problem title="No bijection to Powerset (Cantor's Theorem)" source="Max Obreiter">
    <div label="question">
        Prove that for any set $A$ and any function $f: A \to \mathcal P(A)$, $f$ is not bijective.

        _(This exercise is quite difficult and the first step might appear "random"; with Hint 1 the exercise should be rather easy.)_
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Analyze the set $B = \{ x \in A \; \vert \; x \not\in f(x) \}$. Note that this set is well-defined by the filter axiom (unlike the similar-looking set from Russel's Paradox).
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Assume that $f$ was bijective; what does this say about $B \subseteq \mathcal P(A)$?
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Since $f$ is bijective, it is surjective, which means that there must be some $y \in A$ with $f(y) = B$.
    </div>
    <div label="answer">
        See hints.

        Assume that $y \in B = f(y)$. This is a contradiction since $x \in B \iff x \not\in f(y)$.

        This means that $y \not\in B = f(y)$. But this also leads to a contradiction, since now by definition $B$, we must have $x \in B$.

        This means that such a bijective function $f$ can't exist.

        _Note that this argument only works for the specific choice for $y$, since we need that $B = f(y)$._

        You can also find a slightly more formal version of the proof on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_theorem).
